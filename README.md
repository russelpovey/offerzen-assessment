## Task D

I used the full 4 hours to complete this, I used the majority of the time setting up the ui (2-3hours) and the rest on the functionality.

I usually use styled-components for the styling of my projects, but decided to keep it simple for this demo, so that slowed me down a bit, as well as writing a custom date formatter instead of reaching for dateFns or moment.

I would've liked to have spent more time on the search, granted it was a larger data set, as I took quite simple approach.

I also would've liked to have validated the rendered values in the table - especially the date field.

It feels incomplete without being mobile responsive.
